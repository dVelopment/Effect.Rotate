Effect.Rotate is an extension to the popular script.aculo.us javascript framework (see http://script.aculo.us/ ) for dynamically rotating contents.

== Installation/Usage
Download the latest script.aculo.us package.
Copy script.aculo.us and effect.rotate.js to a dir

Add the following tags to the HEAD section of your HTML page (prototype is included in the script.aculo.us package):

    <script src="js/prototype.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="js/effects.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="js/effect.rotate.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

use the Effect just like every other script.aculo.us effect:

    new Effect.Rotate('idOfElement');
    
Available options:
    degrees: integer (default: 90)
        above zero: clockwise
        below zero: counter clockwise
    mode: ['relative' | 'absolute'] (default: 'relative')
            if set to 'relative', the rotation will continue from any previous rotation
            'absolute' will always start from 0 degrees
            
Elements rotated by this effect will get an additional property _rotation, which saves the current rotation value.
